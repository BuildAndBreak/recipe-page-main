## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 – for meaningful, accessible, and SEO-friendly markup

- **CSS3** – including custom properties (variables) for colors, fonts, and weights, improving maintainability and theming

- **Flexbox** – for alignment and spacing, ensuring a consistent and centered layout

- **Responsive design** – mobile-first workflow to ensure the page scales from small to large screens

- **Google Fonts** – using Inter, Outfit, and Young Serif to establish a clear visual hierarchy

### What I learned

This project demonstrates:

- Effective use of CSS custom properties for consistent styling and easier maintenance.

- Structuring content semantically with HTML sections for ingredients, instructions, and nutrition tables.

- Designing a responsive layout that adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.

- Creating a clear visual hierarchy through color, font weight, and spacing.

### Continued development

- Adding dynamic interactions with JavaScript

- Exploring CSS Grid for more advanced layouts

- Further optimization for accessibility and semantic HTML

- Integrating the recipe page into a component-based framework like React
